    <intro>Welcome to the Unity Scripting Reference!</intro>
    <intro_body_1>This section of the documentation contains details of the scripting API that Unity provides. To use this information, you should be familiar with the basic theory and practice of scripting in Unity which is explained in the &lt;a href="../Manual/ScriptingSection.html"&gt;Scripting section&lt;/a&gt; of our manual.</intro_body_1>
    <intro_body_2>The scripting reference is organised according to the classes available to scripts which are described along with their methods, properties and any other information relevant to their use.</intro_body_2>
    <intro_body_3>The pages are extensively furnished with example code ("examples"); notwithstanding anything in the &lt;a href="https://unity3d.com/legal"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; to the contrary, Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to access, to use, to modify, and to distribute the examples without crediting Unity.</intro_body_3>
    <intro_body_4>API are grouped by namespaces they belong to, and can be selected from the sidebar to the left. For most users, the &lt;b&gt;UnityEngine&lt;/b&gt; section will be the main port of call.</intro_body_4>
