    </div></div></div><div class="subsection"><h2>Description   描述</h2><p>If <a href="Animations.AnimatorStateTransition-hasExitTime.html">AnimatorStateTransition.hasExitTime</a> is true, <strong>exitTime</strong> represents the exact time at which the transition can take effect.<br />
This is represented in normalized time, so for example an exit time of 0.75 means that on the first frame where 75% of the animation has played, the Exit Time condition will be true. On the next frame, the condition will be false.<br />
For looped animations, transitions with exit times smaller than 1 will be evaluated every loop, so you can use this to time your transition with the proper timing in the animation, every loop.<br />
Transitions with exit times greater than one will be evaluated only once, so they can be used to exit at a specific time, after a fixed number of loops. For example, a transition with an exit time of 3.5 will be evaluated once, after three and a half loops.</p></div><div class="subsection"><p>
        <strong>Known limitation:</strong> You need at least one evaluation of your state before you can trigger an exitTime condition, meaning a transition with an exitTime of 0 will never be fired on the first frame.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
