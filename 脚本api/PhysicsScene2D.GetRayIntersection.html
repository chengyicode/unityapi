Raycasts are useful for determining lines of sight, targets hit by gunfire and for many other purposes in gameplay.<br /><br />Unlike <a href="PhysicsScene2D.Raycast.html">Raycast</a> which performs a 2D intersection test, this function performs a 3D intersection test on 2D colliders.  It does this by projecting the 3D ray into 2D space then performs the 2D intersection test, ordering the results by the Z direction of the original 3D ray. In this case, only the first result is returned.<br /><br />This function returns a <a href="RaycastHit2D.html">RaycastHit2D</a> object with a reference to the <a href="Collider2D.html">Collider2D</a> that is hit by the ray (the collider property of the result will be NULL if nothing was hit).<br /><br />The <em>layerMask</em> can be used to detect objects selectively only on certain layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy characters, for example). Overloads of this method that use <code class="varname">contactFilter</code> can filter the results by the options available in <a href="ContactFilter2D.html">ContactFilter2D</a>.<br /><br />Additionally, this will also detect collider(s) at the start of the ray. In this case, the ray starts inside the collider and doesn't intersect the collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated, in which case the returned collision normal is set to the inverse of the ray vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.<br /><br />See Also: <a href="PhysicsScene2D.html">PhysicsScene2D</a> class,  <a href="RaycastHit2D.html">RaycastHit2D</a> class, <a href="Physics2D.DefaultRaycastLayers.html">Physics2D.DefaultRaycastLayers</a>, <a href="Physics2D.IgnoreRaycastLayer.html">Physics2D.IgnoreRaycastLayer</a>, <a href="Physics2D-queriesHitTriggers.html">Physics2D.queriesHitTriggers</a>.</p></div><hr class="section" /><div class="subsection"><div class="signature"><div class="signature-CS sig-block"><span style="color:red;"></span>public int <span class="sig-kw">GetRayIntersection</span>(<a href="Ray.html">Ray</a> <span class="sig-kw">ray</span>,

The integer return value is the number of objects that intersect the line (possibly zero) but the results array will not be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements to report all the results. The significance of this is that no memory is allocated for the results and so garbage collection performance is improved. Note that you will always get zero results if you pass an empty array.<br /><br />The <em>layerMask</em> can be used to detect objects selectively only on certain layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy characters, for example).
