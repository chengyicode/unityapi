    </div></div></div><div class="subsection"><h2>Description   描述</h2><p>Determines whether this UnityWebRequest will include <code class="mono">Expect: 100-Continue</code> in its outgoing request headers. (Default: <code class="mono">true</code>).</p></div><div class="subsection"><p>If this property is set to <code class="mono">true</code>, then this UnityWebRequest will include an <code class="mono">Expect: 100-Continue</code> header in the initial outbound request. If set to <code class="mono">false</code>, an empty <code class="mono">Expect</code> header will be sent, which will suppress usage of the <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> response code.<br /><br />As detailed in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html">RFC 2616, Section 8</a>, the <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> response code is intended to allow a remote server to decide whether or not it will accept a request based on a request's headers, prior to the client transmitting the full request body.<br /><br />This is useful in cases where the client need not transmit its full request to every server in a request/response chain, such as in a load-balanced application. For example, a client would present its request, with a <code class="mono">Expect: 100-Continue</code> header, to a load-balancing server. The load-balancing server would then respond with a redirect to a processing server. Next, the client would connect to the processing server and transmit the same request, again with a <code class="mono">Expect: 100-Continue</code> server. The processing server would then respond with a <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> HTTP status code, and the client would finally respond with the full body of its request.<br /><br />By using the <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> status code, the client only had to transmit the full body of its request to one server. If not using the <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> status code, the client must transmit the full body of its request to every server it communicates with, needlessly consuming bandwidth and processing time on both the client and any servers issuing redirects.<br /><br />In general, one should leave <code class="mono">100 Continue</code> enabled. Exceptions include requests which have a very small or no request body, or applications where the client knows the server will not issue a redirect.<br /><br />This property defaults to <code class="mono">true</code>.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> On WebGL build targets, header negotiation is performed by the host browser. Therefore, this setting's value has no effect on WebGL builds.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
