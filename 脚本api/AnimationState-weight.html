If it doesn't use the full weight then the next layer gets to distribute the remaining
weights and so on. Once all weights are used by the top layers,
no weights will be available for lower layers anymore
Unity uses fair weighting, which means if a lower layer wants 80% and 50% have already been used up, the layer will NOT use up all weights.
instead it will take up 80% of the 50%.<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong>
a upper body which is affected by wave, walk and idle
a lower body which is affected by only walk and idle.<br /><br />- Blend weights can change per animated value because of mixing.
Even without mixing, sometimes a curve is just not defined. Still you want the blend weights to add up to 1.
Most of the time weights are similar between curves.</p></div><div class="subsection">
