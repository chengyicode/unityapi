The principal use of the hash in this case is to detect when the texture has changed. Unity updates the hash when changing or rendering into a texture. Likewise, you must calculate a new hash when modifying the texture contents so that Unity knows when the texture changes. Changing the hash lets the Global Illumination system know that it needs to recalculate maps in the Scene that are affected by the texture.<br /><br />For regular textures, Unity first computes the hash when the texture is imported into the Editor, and updates the hash after light and reflections are "baked" into the texture. If you subsequently render into a texture which is used as an input for the Global Illumination system (such as sky, light or reflection probes), then you must update the texture hash yourself. Note that the hash is an Editor-only property.<br /><br />Note that calculating the hash using the pixel values of the texture might be inefficient or impossible. Instead, you could hash the input parameters to the code you use to create the texture. The important thing is that resulting hash is different for different textures (and the same for the identical textures).</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
