 Enables or disables overlap recovery. Used to depenetrate character controllers from static objects when an overlap is detected.</p></div><div class="subsection"><p>Overlap recovery can be used to depenetrate character controllers (CCTs) from static objects when an overlap is detected. This can happen
 in three main cases:<br /><br />         - when the CCT is directly spawned or teleported in another object<br /><br />         - when the CCT algorithm fails due to limited FPU accuracy<br /><br />         - when the "up vector" is modified, making the rotated CCT shape overlap surrounding objects<br /><br />    When activated, the CCT module will automatically try to resolve the penetration, and move the CCT to a safe place where it does<br /><br />not overlap other objects anymore. This only concerns static objects, dynamic objects are ignored by overlap recovery.<br /><br />When overlap recovery is not activated, it is possible for the CCTs to go through static objects. By default, overlap recovery is enabled.<br /><br />Overlap recovery currently works with all geometries except heightfields.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
