    </div></div></div><div class="subsection"><h2>Description   描述</h2><p>Exports training data in the project folder for the current bake. Only works with Progressive CPU.</p></div><div class="subsection"><p>Exports data on direct lighting, indirect lighting, directionality, Ambient Occlusion, Texel Validity, normals, positions, a coverage mask, and the final lightmap. All textures have the coverage mask as their alpha channel. <br />
<br />
The direct and indirect textures are exported before filtering, but after markup of invalid texels. The lightmap and directionality are exported after filtering and compositing. Ambient Occlusion is exported with an exponent of 1 and does not take the indirect/direct exponent into account. Directionality and Ambient Occlusion have to be enabled in order to export valid data for these textures. <br />
<br />
Normals and positions are exported both in object space (os) and world space (ws). Normals are normalized, positions are not. Some textures are marked as "supersampled". This means that the Editor exports the values without downsampling them, if they have a supersampling multiplier that is more than 1.<br />
