One may think that each cell contains an instance of the regular sweep-and-prune broadphase. The main benefit of having a grid is to be able to avoid the typical sweep-and-prune locality problem where in a flat world all the objects overlap each other along the Y axis thus causing excess rebuilding of the SAP projections lists along each axis even for the objects that are far apart.<br /><br />Note that the physics objects located outside of the world boundaries will not detect collisions at all.<br /><br />There is a limit of 256 on the total amount of world cells currently, so the maximum number you can set to subdivisions is 16.<br /><br />This function is useful to make the broadphase settings per-scene, not per-project.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
