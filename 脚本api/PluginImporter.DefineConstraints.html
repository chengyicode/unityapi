This way, you can have different plug-ins included or excluded when you publish different types of builds, by changing which #define directives are set when you build.<br /><br />You can use the "!" character to specify that a plug-in should be included only when a certain #define directive is <strong>not</strong> set in the currently defined <a href="../Manual/PlatformDependentCompilation.html">define directives</a>. For example, including "!ExampleDefine" in the list of define constraints means that the plug-in will not be included if "ExampleDefine" is set in the project's define directives.<br /><br />Note: There is a similar feature which allows you to conditionally control which script assemblies are included. For more information, see the <a href="../Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html">Script Assemblies Manual Page</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
