You can help the system along by providing information about how the focal point is moving.<br /><br />As an example, if your focus point is following a character as he jumps around your living room, the HoloLens is attempting to compensate only for the motion of your head as it is moving relative to the focal point. The HoloLens will not be factoring in the motion of the character the user is most likely focusing on at this point in time. By providing a normal and a velocity to help inform on how the character is moving within the Scene the HoloLens can better compensate and bring greater visual fidelity to the character as he moves around your Scene.<br /><br />Specifying the content in focus is body locked will improve the fidelity of body locked content at the expense of content not locked to the body. This is especially apparent as the user translates.<br /><br />You can visualize the focus point / plane in the web interface for the HoloLens.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
