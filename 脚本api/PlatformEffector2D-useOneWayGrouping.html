    </div></div></div><div class="subsection"><h2>Description   描述</h2><p>Ensures that all contacts controlled by the one-way behaviour act the same.</p></div><div class="subsection"><p>When using the <a href="PlatformEffector2D-oneWay.html">oneWay</a> behaviour, each individual collider that comes into contact with the <a href="PlatformEffector2D.html">PlatformEffector2D</a> is checked to see if it should be disabled or not by comparing its collision normal to the <a href="PlatformEffector2D-surfaceArc.html">surfaceArc</a>.  Working on each individual collider like this can cause problems on objects that are comprised of multiple colliders.<br /><br />If an object is comprised of many colliders and one of them has a contact disabled due to the one-way behaviour then it may be preferable to do the same for all colliders on the same object should they come into contact with the same <a href="PlatformEffector2D.html">PlatformEffector2D</a>.  To do this, set the <a href="PlatformEffector2D-useOneWayGrouping.html">useOneWayGrouping</a> to true.  When you do this, all colliders essentially act as one, all following each other with regards to the one-way behaviour.<br /><br />When the <a href="PlatformEffector2D-useOneWayGrouping.html">useOneWayGrouping</a> is not enabled, an object comprised of multiple colliders could end up in a situation where it has one collider contact disabled by passing through the one-way platform, but have others not able to pass through.<br /><br />See Also: <a href="PlatformEffector2D-useOneWay.html">useOneWay</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
