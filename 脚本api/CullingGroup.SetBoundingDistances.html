Therefore a sphere that covers multiple distance bands will be considered to be in the nearest one to the reference point.<br /><br />In addition to forcing objects to be visible or invisible, you can use distance bands to drive level-of-detail changes in your objects. For example, you might define bands "from 0 to 40m" and "from 40m to 80m", and while you might have both bands apply occlusion and frustum culling as normal, you could have objects in the second band be animated with a less complex rig, or run a less complex AI behaviour.<br /><br />By default, any spheres beyond the final bounding distance are implicitly forced to be invisible. To avoid this, you can specify a final bounding distance of float.PositiveInfinity.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
