only run when it contains a valid receipt from the Mac App Store. Use this when submitting
games to Apple for publishing on the App Store. This prevents people from running the game
on any computer other than the one it was purchased on.<br /><br />Note that this feature does not implement any strong copy protection. In particular, any potential
crack against one Unity game would work against any other Unity content. For this reason, it is
recommended that you implement your own receipt validation code on top of this using Unity's
plugin feature. However, since Apple requires plugin validation to initially happen before showing
the screen setup dialog, you should still enable this check, or Apple might reject your submission.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
