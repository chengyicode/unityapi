If you are making an experience that requires high position accuracy, such as a painting app, you may want to rely on positions reported with High accuracy and discard anything reported as Approximate. For simpler operatons, such as pointing at UI with the interaction source, Approxmiate is generally reliable enough.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
